            <p>Welcome to my games portfolio! 
                <br> My name is Madison and I am and young game maker 
                with a Bachelor of Game Design and Development from Macquarie University my dream 
                is to make games that show off naratives through many means if that be through 
                classic platformers to rhythm games and more.

                <h4>Role: Narrative Designer, Song Mapper</h4>
                <p>Disco Daimyo DX is a rhythm game thematically set in a highschool where you must bust-a-move against other students.
                    From the classical movements of the orchestral band club to the soft indie beats of the poetry club, Can you master 
                    these songs and take down all the club members?

                <h4>Role: Creative Director, Asset Creator, Level Designer</h4>
                <p>Issues is a travesal and speedy platformor inspired by the "Animation Vs." series. The goal of the player is to escape
                    the page of a comic book before the ink blots over the way out.

                <img src="Images\vr.png" alt="VR project Heart Rate">
                <h4>Role: Solo Developer, Solo Designer, Solo Writer</h4>
                <p>This experience puts the player in the position of a possible suspect of a crime. The police will question the player and 
                    dependent on the player's heart rate the environment will change as they are pushed into a stressful situation. This project 
                    was a exploration into immersion using virtual reality and heart rate can factor into people's choices in narrative games.

                <h3>Project Paint Runner (In Early Development)</h3>
                <h4>Role: Narrative Designer, Lead Writer, Mechanics Developer</h4>
                <p>Project Paint Runner is a momentum-based 3D platformer that takes place in the works of someone's entire life. The player is a 
                    paintbrush escaping the draining colour phenomenon happening to their world.

                <h3>Issues (In Early Development)</h3>
                <h4>Role: Lead Developer, Lead Designer, Narrative designer, Lead Writer</h4>
                <p>This version of Issues will be more true to my vision. Issues is a 2D Beat'em-up focused on the stories of superheroes. They will
                    leap from panel to panel and page to page. The player will fight classic villains of the week and be absorbed in a comic book style
                    story.
